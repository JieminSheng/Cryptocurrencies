# Cryptocurrency Analysis with Unsupervised Machine Learning: Classification of Cryptocurrency Investment Portfolio in Python

## Overview of Project

### Purpose

The purpose of this project is to use unsupervised machine learning to process and cluster data, to reduce dimensions, and to reduce principal components using PCA in order to create an analysis for clients who are preparing to invest in the bank's new cryptocurrency portfolio. The available cryptocurrencies were divided into different classes and successfully plotted in a scatterplot showing how many coins have been minted versus supply which can help to determine the price.
